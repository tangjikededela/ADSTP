# # # This is a UI use case for special pipelines.
# # # The main purpose of this example is to show that when a system is fully established,
# # # monthly reports can be automatically generated with very high efficiency.

# # This UI allows users to select questions about Aberdeen City Council's child protection work,
# # and then generate responses of the same quality as previous years' manual reports.
# # The five available questions are:
# # 1-2 What are the emerging trends or themes emerging from Local and comparators data?
# # 1-3 What are the emerging trends or themes emerging from Local single agency data?
# # 4-1 To what extent is Aberdeen City consistent with the national and comparator averages for re-registration?
# # 5 What is the number of children remaining on the CPR for more than 1 year and can the CPC be assured that it is necessary for any child to remain on the CPR for more than 1 year?
# # 6 To what extent do agencies make use of the CPR?  If they are not utilising it, what are the reasons for that?
