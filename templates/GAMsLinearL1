This is a story to help you understand how {%- for i in range(0,indeNum) %} the {{Xcol[i]}}, {% endfor %} as independent variables affect the {{ycol}} as dependent variable.
After mathematical calculation and analysis of the data,
The R-Squared value for the generalized additive model is {{r2 | round(3)}}.
{%- if r2>=0.5 -%} The value of the metric shows that there is a strong relationship between the chosen independent variables and the dependent variable. You can trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- else -%} The value of the metric shows that there is not a strong relationship between the chosen independent variables and the dependent variable.You cannot trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- endif -%}
{% if trend==0 -%}
 And the expectation is that {{ycol}} should be as low as possible.
{% else -%}
 And the expectation is that {{ycol}} should be as high as possible.
{% endif -%}
 Below is the table of the metadata.
