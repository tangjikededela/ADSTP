This is a data story to help you understand how {% for i in range(0,indeNum) %} {% if i !=(indeNum-1)  -%}the {{Xcol[i]}}, {%- else  -%} and the {{Xcol[i]}} {%endif-%}{%endfor-%} affect the {{ycol}} by fitting the dataset to the {{modelName}}.
First of all, the story will {% if qs[0]==1-%} describe the credibility of the model as a whole. {% endif %}
{%- if qs[1]==1%} Then it will analyze whether each independent variable has a significant effect on the dependent variable {% endif %}
{%- if qs[2]==1 -%}
{%- if t ==0  -%}
, and describe under what circumstances each independent variable can make the dependent variable as small as possible.
{%- elif t ==1 -%}
, and describe under what circumstances each independent variable can make the dependent variable as large as possible.
{%- else -%}

{%- endif -%} {%- endif -%}
{%- if qs[2]==1 or qs[1]==1 %} Finally, the story will {% endif -%} summarize the analysis results{%- if qs[3]==1 %} and measure the importance of each independent variable{%- endif -%}.
{% if qs[0]==1%}
{% if r2 > 0.5 and expect==1 -%}
As you might expect, the model is credible for the following reasons.
{% elif r2 < 0.5 and expect==0 -%}
As you might expect, the model is not credible for the following reasons.
{% elif r2 > 0.5 and expect==0 -%}
Unlike what you might expect, the model is credible for the following reasons.
{% elif r2 < 0.5 and expect==1 -%}
Unlike what you might expect, the model is not credible for the following reasons.
{% elif expect=="" -%}

{% endif -%}
The R-Squared for the {{modelName}} has a value of {{r2 | round(3)}}.
{% if r2 < 0.3 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is none or very weak. You should not trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% elif r2 < 0.5 and r2 > 0.3 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is weak or low. You might not use the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% elif r2 < 0.7 and r2 > 0.5 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is moderate. You could trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% else -%}
So, there is a strong relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable. You can trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
