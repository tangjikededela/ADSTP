This is a data story to help you understand how {%- for i in range(0,indeNum) %} {%- if i !=(indeNum-1)  -%}{{Xcol[i]}}, {%- else  -%} and {{Xcol[i]}} {%endif-%}{%endfor-%} affect {{ycol}} by fitting the dataset to {{modelName}}.
First of all, the story will {% if qs[0]==1-%} describe the credibility of the model as a whole. Then it will {% endif %}
{%- if qs[1]==1%} analyze whether each independent variable has a significant effect on the dependent variable, and {% endif %}
{%- if qs[2]==1 -%}
{%- if t ==1  -%}
describe under what circumstances each independent variable can make the dependent variable as small as possible.
{%- elif t ==0 -%}
describe under what circumstances each independent variable can make the dependent variable as large as possible.
{%- else -%}

{%- endif -%} {%- endif -%}
{%- if qs[2]==1 or qs[1]==1 -%} Finally, the story will {% endif -%} summarize the analysis results{%- if qs[3]==1 %} and measure the importance of each independent variable{%- endif -%}.


{%- if qs[0]==1%}
The R-Squared for the {{modelName}} has a value of {{r2 | round(3)}}.
{%- if r2 < 0.3 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is None or Very weak. You should not trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- elif r2 < 0.5 and r2 > 0.3 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is Weak or Low. You might not use the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- elif r2 < 0.7 and r2 > 0.5 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is Moderate. You could trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{%- else -%}
So, there is a strong relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable. You can trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
