This is a data story to help you understand how {% for i in range(0,indeNum) %} {% if i !=(indeNum-1)  -%} {{Xcol[i]}}, {%- else  -%} and {{Xcol[i]}} {%endif-%}{%endfor-%} affect the probability of {{ycol}} by fitting the dataset to the {{modelName}}.
First of all, the story will {% if qs[0]==1-%} describe the goodness-of-fit of the model. Then it will {% endif %}
{%- if qs[1]==1%} analyze whether each independent variable has a significant effect on the dependent variable. {% endif %}
{%- if qs[2]==1 -%}
{%- if t ==1  -%}
describe under what circumstances each independent variable can make the dependent variable as small as possible.
{%- elif t ==0 -%}
describe under what circumstances each independent variable can make the dependent variable as large as possible.
{%- else -%}

{%- endif -%} {%- endif -%}
{%- if qs[2]==1 or qs[1]==1 %} Finally, the story will {% endif -%} summarize the analysis results{%- if qs[3]==1 %} and measure the importance of each independent variable{%- endif -%}.
{% if qs[0]==1%}
The value of deviance divided by the degree of freedom for the {{modelName}} is  {{r2 | round(3)}}.
{%- if r2 < 2 and r2>=1%} The value of deviance divided by the degree of freedom is less than 2, so the model could be considered a moderately good fit for the dataset.
{%- elif r2 < 1 and r2>=0.5%} The value of deviance divided by the degree of freedom is less than 1, so the model could be considered a very good fit for the dataset.
{%- elif r2 < 0.5 %} The value of deviance divided by the degree of freedom is less than 0.5, so the model may be overfitting.
{%- else %} The value of deviance divided by the degree of freedom is greater than 2, so the model may be underfitting.
