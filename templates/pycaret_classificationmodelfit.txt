The accuracy for the {{modelName}} has a value of {{r2 | round(3)}}.
{% if r2 < 0.9 -%}
So, The accuracy of the classifier is not high enough.
{% else -%}
So, The accuracy of the classifier is high enough.
{% endif %} And the AUC (Area Under the Curve) has a value of {{mape | round(3)}},
{%if mape <= 0.5 -%}
which indicates the classifier is no better than random guessing.
{%elif mape > 0.5 and mape<0.7 -%}
which indicates the classifier is better than random guessing, but is not accurate enough.
{%elif mape >= 0.7 and mape<0.8 -%}
which indicates the classifier is considered acceptable.
{%elif mape >= 0.8 and mape<0.9 -%}
which indicates the good performance of the classifier.
{% else -%}
which indicates the very good performance of the classifier.
