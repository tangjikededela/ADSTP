The R-Squared for the {{modelName}} has a value of {{r2 | round(3)}}.
{% if r2 < 0.3 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is None or Very weak. You should not trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% elif r2 < 0.5 and r2 > 0.3 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is Weak or Low. You might not use the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% elif r2 < 0.7 and r2 > 0.5 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is Moderate. You could trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% else -%}
So, there is a strong relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable. You can trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% endif %} And the mean absolute percentage error has a value of {{mape | round(3)}},
{%if mape < 0.05 -%}
which means the forecast of the model is acceptable with good accuracy.
{% elif mape < 0.1 and mape>0.05-%}
which means  the forecast of the model is acceptably accurate.
{% elif mape < 0.25 and mape>0.1-%}
which means  the forecast of the model has low accuracy, but still acceptable.
{% else -%}
which means  the forecast of the model is not acceptable in terms of its very low accuracy.
